# CSC348B Project

English | [简体中文](https://github.com/HtmlIsTheBestProgrammingLanaguage/myFirstApp/blob/main/README_ZH.md) 

This project uses the initial name it had, which is the default name when creating a new Laravel project. I couldn't come up with a more appropriate name for this project, and perhaps the default is a decent choice.

## Project Introduction

This project is developed using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework and aims to create a personal information publishing platform. The platform allows users to publish information, browse information published by other users, and interact with them. The project was completed on May 2, 2023, and was submitted as an assignment for CSC348B at Swansea University. **Please do not use any code from this project for your personal assignments or academic reports.**

## Project Features

- User registration and login functionality, although I have customized the login and registration pages using Laravel's login interface.
- Multiple user levels, including guest, registered user, and administrator.
- Clicking on a user's avatar will redirect to the user's introduction page, which displays their posts and comments.
- Users can delete and edit their own posts and comments, while administrators can delete any post or comment from any user.
- Random data is generated using Faker, such as random text, usernames, and email addresses for testing.
- The project uses Laravel's built-in relational database and correctly sets the relationships between tables.
- Commenting feature allows logged-in users to comment on posts.
- AJAX is used for posting comments, allowing users to post comments without refreshing the page.
- CSS styles are applied to enhance user experience.
- JavaScript is used for the like functionality, asynchronously loading the current number of likes for a post.
- A simple API for post like counts is set up using Jetty.
- Notification system alerts users when their posts receive comments from other users.
- Laravel's built-in file upload server is used for image uploads, allowing users to add images to their posts, which can be viewed by other users when viewing the posts.
